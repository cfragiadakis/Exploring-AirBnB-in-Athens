# Exploring AirBnB in Athens
This project implements an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of AirBnB listings in Athens, leveraging data obtained from [Inside AirBnB](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/). With the use of Python visualization libraries (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `folium`) the purpose is to extract insights about the effect of AirBnB in the city.


## Objectives
The primary objectives of the analysis include:

* Identifying the most popular neighborhoods in Athens and exploring their average listing prices.
* Analyze the availability of listings on a daily basis to identify booking trends.
* Calculating the average price per day for booking an AirBnB in Athens.
* Exploring the distribution of listings among hosts, to identify prominent hosts and discern whether listings are primarily owned by individuals or managed as part of business operations.

Furthermore, using the [data assumptions](https://insideairbnb.com/data-assumptions/) by Inside AirBnB, we can estimate:
* The average occupacy of a listing per month.
* The average monthly income of a listing in Athens.
* The average yearly income per neighbourhood.

## Interactive Maps

With the use of the `folium` library, the following interactive maps of AirBnB listings in Athens are created:

1. The [first map](https://github.com/cfragiadakis/Exploring-AirBnB-in-Athens/blob/main/maps/athens_airbnb_map.html) provides descriptive information for each listing, including neighbourhood, room type, price and url. 
2. The [second map](https://github.com/cfragiadakis/Exploring-AirBnB-in-Athens/blob/main/maps/athens_airbnb_map2.html) visualizes listings based on their ratings and number of reviews, helping potential guests identify the best opportunities for booking in Athens.
   
**Note**: if you click a URL and visit the listing, you might find slight inaccuracies with some data presented in the map. This may happen because the last edition of data of [Inside AirBnB](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) refer until December, 2023

The analysis can be replicated by using the data from any other city for which data is available on [Inside AirBnB](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/). You can simply download and replace the data files within the notebook, and extract insights about AirBnB accross different landscapes.
