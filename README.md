# Exploring-AirBnB

In this project, we collect data from [Inside AirBnB](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/), and particularly the Athens data, to implement an exploratory data analysis of AirBnB and extract useful insights, using Python visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Folium) 

More specifically, we extract insights such as:
* Neighbourhood Prices
* Availability per day
* Listings per room type
* Prices per day
* Listings per host

Furthermore, using the [data assumptions](https://insideairbnb.com/data-assumptions/) by Inside AirBnB, we can calculate an approximation for insights such as:
* Average Occupacy for a listing
* Average Monthly Income for a listing
