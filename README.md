# Exploring-AirBnB

In this project, we collect data from [Inside AirBnB](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/), and particularly the Athens data, to implement an exploratory data analysis of AirBnB and extract useful insights, using Python visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Folium)
